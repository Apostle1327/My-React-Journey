# ⚡️ Welcome to My React + Vite Journey! 🚀

Hey there! I'm Neville, and I'm hyped to take this next big step into the modern web dev universe with React and Vite. From handling components to building lightning-fast apps, I'm ready to build, break, and rebuild on this awesome ride.

## Learning Goals 🎯

In this new chapter of my journey, I’m aiming to:

- **Get comfortable with React fundamentals:** From components, props, and state to hooks like useState and useEffect, I’m ready to think in React!

- **Master the Vite-powered workflow:** ’ll explore how Vite simplifies and speeds up modern frontend development — no more waiting around for sluggish builds.

- **Create real-world apps that look and feel amazing:** Because nothing teaches better than doing — I’ll be building sleek, responsive, and functional web apps using React, powered by Vite.

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- React: Declarative, component-based UI building.
- Vite: Fast dev server and optimized builds.
- JavaScript (ES6+): Still the heartbeat of everything.
- CSS / Tailwind / Styled Components: TBD — but I'm styling with purpose.
